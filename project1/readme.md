## Summary

A python script that spins up a VM of a given specification, and executes another script on said VM. The script execution should be containerized. Before the script is run, given assumptions about the scriptâ€™s runtime, an estimated cost will be calculated. After the script is finished, output files will be put in cloud storage. Then, after the entire execution is completed, the VM will be spun down. Finally, a text/email will be sent with a user given job name, the original estimated cost, the actual cost, and other potential useful information. The solution should be implemented as in a code as infrastructure solution.  No restrictions on cloud provider.

### 1. Create a docker image that runs a script and copys the output file to an s3 bucket
* Go to docker folder:<br>
    ```
        sudo docker build -t p1image .
    ```
    ```
       sudo docker run -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='' -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='' stanworld/p1image
    ```
### 2. Create a terraform configuration that runs the image in a VM instance
* Set up docker repo
   ```
        sudo docker tag p1image stanworld/p1image
   ```
   ```
        sudo docker push stanworld/p1image
   ```
* In user_data piece calling docker run
* set up an iam_instance_profile for an AWS EC2 instance in Terraform with s3 permissions. If your VM instance is running in AWS, you can associate an IAM role with the instance that grants the necessary AWS permissions. The IAM role can be assumed by the EC2 instance, and any AWS CLI commands or SDK calls made within the instance (including Docker containers) will automatically use the associated role's permissions.
### 3. Use python to orchestrate the process
